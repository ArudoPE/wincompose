{"name":"Wincompose","tagline":"Compose Key for Windows","body":"﻿WinCompose\r\n==========\r\n\r\n![Icon](/web/icon.png)\r\n\r\nA robust compose key for Windows, written by Sam Hocevar.\r\n\r\nIt allows to easily write characters such as **é ž à ō û ø ☺ ¤\r\n∅ « ♯ ⸘ Ⓚ ㊷ ♪ ♬** using short and often very intuitive key\r\ncombinations. For instance, **ö** is obtained using **o** and **\"**, and\r\n**♥** is obtained using **<** and **3**.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\nLatest release: [WinCompose-Setup-0.4.5.exe](/bin/WinCompose-Setup-0.4.5.exe)\r\n\r\nQuick start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nAfter installation, WinCompose should appear in the System Tray;\r\notherwise, launch it manually:\r\n\r\n![Quick Launch](/web/shot1.png)\r\n\r\nPress and release the **Right Alt** key to initiate a compose sequence; the\r\nicon should change to indicate a compose sequence is in progress:\r\n\r\n![In Progress](/web/shot2.png)\r\n\r\nType in the keys for a compose sequence, such as **A** then **E** for **Æ**:\r\n\r\n![In Progress](/web/shot3.png)\r\n\r\nIf **Right Alt** is not suitable for you, right click on the tray icon to\r\nchoose another key.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nCompose rules are supposed to be intuitive. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n - **` a** → **à**\r\n - **' e** → **é**\r\n - **^ i** → **î**\r\n - **~ n** → **ñ**\r\n - **/ o** → **ø**\r\n - **\" u** → **ü**\r\n - **o c** → **©**\r\n - **+ -** → **±**\r\n - **: -** → **÷**\r\n - **C C C P** → **☭**\r\n - **( 2 3 )** → **㉓**\r\n - **< 3** → **♥**\r\n\r\nThe full list of rules can be found in the `Compose.txt` file shipped with\r\nWinCompose, or by clicking on the WinCompose system tray icon or using the\r\n“Show Sequences…” menu entry:\r\n\r\n![Sequence List](/web/shot4.png)\r\n\r\nThe window allows you to filter the sequences being listed.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWinCompose supports the standard Compose file format. It ships with more than\r\n1000 compose rules from [Xorg](http://www.x.org/wiki/). You can add custom\r\nrules but the file will be overwritten when you upgrade the software.\r\n\r\nWinCompose supports rules of more than 2 characters such as **( 3 )**\r\nfor **③**.\r\n\r\nWinCompose supports early exits. For instance, **Compose &** will\r\nimmediately type **&** because there is currently no rule starting with **&**.\r\n\r\nWinCompose does not emit unnecessary keystrokes, such as a backspace keystroke\r\nto erase the composing characters. Only the final character is sent to the\r\ncurrent application.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n----\r\n\r\nThere are no known bugs in WinCompose.\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs to Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net>\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.4.5 (13 September 2013)\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n - Support for numeric keypad keys.\r\n - Bugfix for pure ASCII compose sequences.\r\n - Cosmetic UI fixes.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.4.4 (2 September 2013)\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n - Support for Unicode codepoints above U+FFFF.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.4.3 (23 August 2013)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n - Support for 32-bit Windows.\r\n - Support for the X-Chat IRC client.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.4.2 (11 June 2013)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n - Better support for GTK+ applications such as Pidgin.\r\n - Minor GUI fixes.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.4.1 (6 May 2013)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n - “Menu”, “Escape” and “Backtick?? can now act as compose\r\n   keys, too.\r\n - Improved the filtering logic.\r\n - Allow to choose the timeout delay from the context menu.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.4.0 (4 May 2013)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n - “Pause” and “Scroll Lock” can now act as compose keys, too.\r\n - It is possible to filter sequences by keyword\r\n - The sequence window can be resized and is displayed with a simple\r\n   click on the systray icon.\r\n - Cosmetic fixes in the GUI.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.3.0 (26 April 2013)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n - The key used for composing is now customisable.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.2.0 (24 April 2013)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n - Highly improved compatibility with games.\r\n - “Typing” and “Disabled” icons are now more easily told apart.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.1.1 (23 April 2013)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n - Admin privileges are no longer required to start WinCompose at startup.\r\n\r\nNews for version 0.1 (22 April 2013)\r\n------------------------------------\r\n - Initial release.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
